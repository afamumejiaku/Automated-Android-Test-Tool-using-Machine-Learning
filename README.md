# Automated-Android-Test-Tool-using-Machine-Learning
In this project, we present an automated testing tool for testing the android applications such as gmail, outlook etc., in order to find the functional bugs in them using the machine learning approach. Here, on the basis of the type of application certain set of test cases are applied on it at the user interface level in order to detect any possible bugs.

Objective and the problem : To automate and maximise the process of detection of functional and UI bugs within an android application. The manual testing approach is usually time consuming and takes up a huge amount of resources with the end result not being accurate. Here we propose to develop an automated testing tool for the android applications using machine learning techniques.
